```{r setup, include=FALSE}
##install.packages("rmarkdown","knitr","readxl","leaps")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Import raw data and review the data.

```{r}
library(readxl)
First_degree_science <- read_excel("First degree science.xlsx", sheet = "Cleaning")
```

See correlations across the board. 
```{r}
##install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
sigcorr <- cor.mtest(First_degree_science[,4:9],conf.level = 0.9)
corrplot.mixed(cor(First_degree_science[,4:9],use = "pairwise.complete.obs"), upper = "ellipse", tl.col = "black", number.cex = .7, tl.pos = "lt", tl.cex=.7, p.mat = sigcorr$p, sig.level = .1)
```

Finding the best model using the smallest AIC score. First treat citation outcome as binary. 

```{r}
library(MASS)
logit_model1 <- stepAIC(glm(citation_binary ~ age + socioeconomic + quantitative + NOAA_affiliation + US_focused, data = First_degree_science, family = binomial), direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
summary(logit_model1)
```

Test the heteroskedasticity of the model with the lowest AIC score.

```{r}
fitted_value <- fitted(logit_model1)
residuals <- resid(logit_model1)
heteroskedasticity_test <- lm (fitted_value ~ residuals)
summary(heteroskedasticity_test)
```

```{r}
plot(fitted_value, residuals)
abline(h = 0, col = "salmon")
```

Estimate the marginal effect of NOAA affiliation.

```{r}
##install.packages("margins")
library(margins)
marginal_effect <- margins(glm(citation_binary ~ NOAA_affiliation + age, data = First_degree_science, family = "binomial"), type = "response")
summary(marginal_effect)
```



Next treat citation outcome as continuous.

```{r}
library(leaps)
mod1 <- regsubsets(citation ~ age + socioeconomic + quantitative + NOAA_affiliation + US_focused, data = First_degree_science)
mod1sum <- summary(mod1)
modnum <- which.max(mod1sum$adjr2)
First_degree_science_temp <- First_degree_science[,c("citation", colnames(mod1sum$which)[mod1sum$which[modnum,] == "TRUE"][-1])]
linear_model1 <- lm(citation ~.,data = First_degree_science_temp)
summary(linear_model1)
```

NOAA Affiliation seems to be the single most powerful indicator of citation outcome. 

Visualize the relationship between age and citation outcome. Convert variables into factors before visualization.

```{r}
First_degree_science$citation_factor <- factor(First_degree_science$citation_binary,levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
First_degree_science$NOAA_affiliation_factor <- factor(First_degree_science$NOAA_affiliation,levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
boxplot(age~citation_factor, data=First_degree_science, horizontal = TRUE, main = "Box Plot of Age vs. Citation",  xlab = "Age", ylab = "Citation", col=c("seagreen","paleturquoise4"))
```

Visualize the relationship between age and NOAA Affiliation.

```{r}
boxplot(age~NOAA_affiliation_factor, data=First_degree_science, horizontal = TRUE, main = "Box Plot of Age vs. NOAA Affiliation",  xlab = "Age", ylab = "NOAA Affiliation", col=c("skyblue","steelblue"))
```

Visualize the relationship between socioeconomic and NOAA Affiliation.

```{r}
First_degree_science$socioeconomic_factor <- factor(First_degree_science$socioeconomic,levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
First_degree_science$quantitative_factor <- factor(First_degree_science$quantitative,levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
First_degree_science$US_focused_factor <- factor(First_degree_science$US_focused,levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
##install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(First_degree_science, aes(x = NOAA_affiliation_factor, fill = socioeconomic_factor)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Proportion Plot of NOAA Affiliation vs. Socioeconomic Research",
       x = "NOAA Affiliation",
       y = "Socioeconomic Research") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Yes" = "cadetblue", "No" = "aquamarine3"))+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("No", "Yes"))
```

Visualize the relationship between quantitative method and a focus on the US.

```{r}
ggplot(First_degree_science, aes(x = US_focused_factor, fill = quantitative_factor)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Proportion Plot of Quantitative Method vs. US Focus",
       x = "US Focus",
       y = "Quantitative Method") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Yes" = "lightcyan", "No" = "lightskyblue2"))+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("No", "Yes"))
```
The relationship between a focus on the US and NOAA affiliation is not examined since NOAA is a U.S. federal agency, and it is natural that all NOAA produced science cares about the U.S.

Analyze the relationships between first degree science and second degree science using network analysis method.

```{r}
##install.packages("igraph")
library(igraph)
Network_analysis <- read_excel("Second degree science.xlsx")
graph <- graph_from_data_frame(Network_analysis, directed = TRUE)
out_degree <- degree(graph, mode = "out")
V(graph)$color <- ifelse(V(graph)$name %in% Network_analysis$to_article, "lightblue","azure" )
V(graph)$size <- ifelse(out_degree > 1, 15, 10)
plot(
  graph,
  edge.arrow.size = 0.5,
  edge.arrow.width = 1,
  edge.width = 1.5,
  main = "Citation Pattern among First- and Second-degree Science"
)
legend("topright",
       legend = c("Cited once", "Cited more than once", "First-degree Science", "Second-degree Science"),
       pch = c(1, 1, 15, 15),  
       col = c("black", "black", "lightblue","azure"), 
       pt.cex = c(1, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5), 
       cex = 1, 
       bty = "n",
       x.intersp = 0.3, 
       y.intersp = 0.4, 
       xjust = 1,  
       yjust = 1)  
```

##Are there differences between cited articles and articles that are not cited at all?##
Are there differences between directly cited articles and the rest? Again we are using logit model and treating both citation outcome as binary.

```{r}
Overall <- read_excel("Second degree science.xlsx", sheet = "Lump")
##logit_model2 <- stepAIC(glm(citation_binary ~ socioeconomic + quantitative + NOAA_affiliation + US_focused, data = Overall, family = binomial), direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
##summary(logit_model2)
logit_model3 <- stepAIC(glm(direct_citation_binary ~ socioeconomic + quantitative + NOAA_affiliation + US_focused, data = Overall, family = binomial), direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
summary(logit_model3)
```

Next we focus on variation across directly and indirectly cited science, excluding the academic sample, and look for the best model.

```{r}
Second_degree_science <- read_excel("Second degree science.xlsx", sheet = "Cleaning")
logit_model4 <- stepAIC(glm(direct_citation_binary ~ socioeconomic + quantitative + NOAA_affiliation + US_focused, data = Second_degree_science, family = binomial), direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
summary(logit_model4)
```
Try treating total citation outcome as continuous.

```{r}
mod2 <- regsubsets(total_citation ~ socioeconomic + quantitative + NOAA_affiliation + US_focused, data = Second_degree_science)
mod2sum <- summary(mod2)
modnum <- which.max(mod2sum$adjr2)
Second_degree_science_temp <- Second_degree_science[,c("total_citation", colnames(mod2sum$which)[mod2sum$which[modnum,] == "TRUE"][-1])]
linear_model2 <- lm(total_citation ~.,data = Second_degree_science_temp)
summary(linear_model2)
```
NOAA affiliation is the single most predictor of citation outcome. Focus on indirect citation by NOAA publications.

```{r}
logit_model5 <- stepAIC(glm(NOAA_citation ~ socioeconomic + quantitative + NOAA_affiliation + US_focused, data = Second_degree_science, family = binomial), direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
summary(logit_model5)
```

Apparently, A NOAA publication does not privilege other NOAA publications. As long as they are U.S. relevant, they will cite. Confirm this finding by treating NOAA citation as a continuous outcome.


```{r}
mod3 <- regsubsets(NOAA_citation ~  direct_citation + socioeconomic + quantitative + NOAA_affiliation + US_focused, data = Second_degree_science)
mod3sum <- summary(mod3)
modnum <- which.max(mod3sum$adjr2)
Second_degree_science_temp <- Second_degree_science[,c("NOAA_citation", colnames(mod3sum$which)[mod3sum$which[modnum,] == "TRUE"][-1])]
linear_model3 <- lm(NOAA_citation ~.,data = Second_degree_science_temp)
summary(linear_model3)
```

```{r}
attach(Second_degree_science)
contingency_table <- table(NOAA_citation, NOAA_affiliation)
chi_square_test <- chisq.test(contingency_table)
print(chi_square_test)
```



```{r}
attach(Second_degree_science)
contingency_table <- table(NOAA_citation, quantitative)
chi_square_test <- chisq.test(contingency_table)
print(chi_square_test)
```

```{r}
attach(Second_degree_science)
contingency_table <- table(NOAA_citation, US_focused)
chi_square_test <- chisq.test(contingency_table)
print(chi_square_test)
```


```{r}
attach(Second_degree_science)
contingency_table <- table(NOAA_citation, socioeconomic)
chi_square_test <- chisq.test(contingency_table)
print(chi_square_test)
```


NOAA affiliation might have some correlation
